# Image-Processing   
An image is represented as a multidimensional array. In Python, it is of the data type numpy; while in C, it is Mat.     
The coordinates (0, 0) are in the upper0left corner. When you have a colored image, there will be three color values for each coordinate. Depending on the resolution and color depth, those arrays can vary in size. The color values go from 0 to 255. Note that with OpenCV, you first specify the Y and then the X coordinate
